The libk to a website I was using for hosting - https://app.netlify.com

I wam inspired by this website, because this company is doing an interstate Work and Travel programm, in wbhich I am taking part right now.

I used different types of creating an HTML pages, modified the website using a variation of CSS properties and made the webiste alive using basic JavaScript.

It contains 6 differently created HTML files, also they are differntly styled.

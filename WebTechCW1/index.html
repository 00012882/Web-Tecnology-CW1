                    <p class="beauty">Work and travel programs are relatively new, so we don’t blame you for wanting to get to know them a bit better before diving in. In fact, when we first started Remote Year, work and travel programs weren’t really a thing.
    
                        In 2014, Greg Caplan and Sam Pessin - the cofounders of Remote Year - were looking for a way to continue building their careers while traveling the world. They knew that people were the most creative and productive when they were inspired by their surroundings and that, with a great WiFi connection, great work could be done from anywhere.
                        
                        We’ve led the way by ushering in a remote work lifestyle that doesn’t separate work from “real life” - it brings the two together so that each can be pursued to its full potential. That’s what we believe a work and travel program should do.</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="faq-page"> <strong> Who is this program for? </strong>
            <ul class="faq-body">
                <li>The program is suitable for the full-time students of the universities in the age of 18-24 years old.</li>

        </li>
        <li class="faq-page"> <strong> May I change my job offer without any permission from my supervisor if I have some problems with employer? </strong>
            <ul class="faq-body">
                <li>Changing job is not recommended during the program, unless there are clear violations from the employer or solid reasons for changing the job. You cannot change jobs by yourself, you need to contact your sponsor and partner agency first and describe all the facts and reasons why you
                    want to do it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-page"> <strong> May I return back to Uzbekistan if I have any emergency situations? </strong>
            <ul class="faq-body">
                <li>In cases of emergency or exceptional need (like sickness, death or sickness of relative, etc.) you may return to your home country and end your program prematurely. You will not be given refund for the program and your visa status will be ‘program ended’. But it will not affect your future visa applications, as long as you approve this with your sponsor beforehand. Make sure to first inform your sponsor and ensure the program is taken care of.</li>

                    There is no limit to working hours. On average, first employers provide 32-40 hours per week. But, it is important to students to have a cultural exchange and sleep on time.</li>

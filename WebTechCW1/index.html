                    <p class="beauty">Work and travel programs are relatively new, so we don’t blame you for wanting to get to know them a bit better before diving in. In fact, when we first started Remote Year, work and travel programs weren’t really a thing.
    
                        In 2014, Greg Caplan and Sam Pessin - the cofounders of Remote Year - were looking for a way to continue building their careers while traveling the world. They knew that people were the most creative and productive when they were inspired by their surroundings and that, with a great WiFi connection, great work could be done from anywhere.
                        
                        We’ve led the way by ushering in a remote work lifestyle that doesn’t separate work from “real life” - it brings the two together so that each can be pursued to its full potential. That’s what we believe a work and travel program should do.</p>

            <h2 class="faq-page beauty">May I change my job offer without any permission from my supervisor if I have some problems with employer?</h2>

But it will not affect your future visa applications, as long as you approve this with your sponsor beforehand. Make sure to first inform your sponsor and ensure the program is taken care of.</p>

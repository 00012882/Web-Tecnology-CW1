                    <p><strong>Michael Jackson</strong></p>
                    <p>Working in a busy kitchen with so many different things happening at once has taught me to be far more independent and deal with stress much better. My manager taught me there’s always a solution, even when things get difficult. As long as I don’t give up, I will accomplish all of my goals and dreams instead of just wasting my time on social media. I also discovered I actually like country music! <br> <br>    

                        I worked at Joe’s Crab Shack, Nashville, TN.</p>

                    <p>I was so excited to learn that I would be working near the beach because my country does not have oceans. It was so beautiful; this was a dream come true! I loved meeting many wonderful people from different cultures, all in one place. This was the America that everyone always talks about, but I feel so lucky that I got to see it in person. <br> <br> I worked at Eagles Beachwear, Myrtle Beach, SC</p>

                    <p>I always dreamed of running my own restaurant, but I hated cleaning the mess up after cooking. After doing only that for 4 months, I realized that its a small but important part of a restaurant. I still don’t like it, but now that I have seen how a restaurant works from the inside, I can own the business instead and hire someone else to do this job for my own restaurant. My dream is now more real than ever. <br><br>

                        I worked at Nathan’s Famous Inc., Jericho, NY</p>

                    <p><strong>Bruce Wayne</strong></p>
                    <p>I was someone who was usually late, but having a job with people who depended on me helped me learn how to manage my time and take responsibility for my actions. I made a lot of new friends from different parts of the world and I someday I will visit them in their home county one day. <br> <br>

                        I worked at Dunkin Donuts, Moultonborough, NH.</p>

                    <p><strong>Margaret Tetcher</strong></p>
                    <p>I was very confident in my English, but being around native speakers really improved my English to a whole new level that just can’t be learned in school. I enjoyed so many different types of food and drinks, that I am going to learn how to make some of them for my friends back home. <br> <br>

                        I worked Sports at Alley, Virginia Beach, VA.</p>

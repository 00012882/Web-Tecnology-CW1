                <h1><strong> Why you should visit USA? </strong></h1>
               
                <ol>
                    <li>The USA’s tourism industry is booming. As a tourist-friendly and well-connected country, you will have no trouble exploring most of the country’s tourist destinations. It is often difficult to visit all the places in one trip because of the sheer size of the country, so you can plan a trip to the west coast or the east coast, to begin with. But if you have several days to spare, you could go on a long road trip covering more places. With an average of around 80 million tourists each year, it is one of the most visited countries in the world. New York City is the no.1 tourist destination in the US. Other best tourist spots in the USA include the White House in Washington DC, California, Florida, and Texas, among others.</li>
                    <li>With more than 50 national parks and a variety of astounding geographic features, including the iconic Great Canyon, Niagara Falls, long east and west coasts, exotic islands, volcanoes, the USA is a treat for lovers of nature and the wild. Traveling to these national parks is easy as they are all very well-connected with the cities and towns. The Yellowstone National Park was the world’s first national park, set aside in 1872. It has many hot springs and geothermal features. The Denali National Park has an incredible landscape and a wide variety of wild flora and fauna. One must also check out the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which is famous for hikes and camps.</li>
                    <li>The USA is one of the oldest democracies in the world. There are many museums and monuments that show us a glimpse of the past. From the Metropolitan Museum of Art and American Museum of Natural History in New York to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, this is the perfect place for all the science and art buffs. The Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore, The Golden Gate Bridge, Museum of American Revolution, etc. are some fascinating historical monuments that give a rich insight into the USA’s glorious past.</li>
                    <li>The USA shares its entire northern border with Canada. With beautiful tourist attractions like Niagara Falls, travelers get a nice glimpse of Canada from these places. You can also visit the exotic island of Hawaii if you want to enjoy a beautiful and breathtaking beach vacation. With an indigenous culture that is still preserved, you will see a different side of America that is not usually in the mainstream.</li>
